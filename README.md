# Tunes to Tickets App
## Authored by Pranav Civi, Guhan Sivakumar, and Karen Nguyen

This web application allows a user to login through Spotify and receive Ticketmaster Concert recommendations based on their listening history and top artists

Disclaimers:
  1. The app is currently in development mode. When Spotify approves our request for public use, it will be available to all users
  2. The Ticketmaster API allows only 5000 calls per day, so if the app stops working, this may be the reason.
